## 3 < 1 concept
For this course I had to think of three different ideas that implement realtime data with Socket.io and the use of an API.

### Guess the Marvel character ❓
I found out that Marvel has their own API. I really wanted to make a game based on all the characters from the Marel Universe. This game will contain a chatbox where the users can communicate and send their answers.

### Yahtzee 🎲
My first thought for this course was to make my all time favourite game, Yahtzee. I know there are/is API's for rolling dices.

### Pesten (Dutch card game) ♠️♥️♣️♦️
I knew that there was an API for decks for cards, so I thought it would be cool to replicate this Dutch card game. 
* You'll need a minimum of two players. 
* Every player gets zeven cards and all the leftover cards will be in the pile on the table.
* The goal of the game is to lose your cards as soon as possible but there are certain rules when you can play a card away.
